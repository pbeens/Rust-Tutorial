# 👋 Welcome to the Rust Tutorial

This tutorial is designed for beginners who want to learn the Rust programming language from the ground up. Whether you’re coming from Python, JavaScript, C++, or starting fresh, this guide will help you understand Rust’s unique features, syntax, and strengths — one step at a time.

## 📚 What You’ll Learn

- How to write and run your first Rust program
- How to use variables, types, and control flow
- How to work with input/output
- How to format and print information
- How to perform basic math and logic operations
- How to use external crates like `rand` and `macroquad` for graphics
- How to write reusable code using functions
- How to structure projects using Cargo

Each concept is introduced with annotated examples, visual guides, and ▶️ Run in Playground links so you can experiment interactively.

## 🧰 What You’ll Need

You can start writing Rust code in one of two ways:

1. 🖥 **Install Rust on your local machine**  
2. 🌐 **Use the Rust Playground in your browser**

📘 For detailed setup instructions, see [`setup.md`](./setup.md)

## 🗂 Folder Structure

This repository is organized into:

- `main/` — Core learning modules (`print.md`, `math.md`, etc.)
- `exercises/` — Hands-on practice grouped by topic
- `solutions/` — Suggested answers to exercises
- `setup.md` — How to install Rust and run code
- `ToDo.md` — Open ideas and development tasks

## ✅ How to Use This Guide

🧭 **Start with [`getting-started-code.md`](./getting-started-code.md)** to get an overview of the tutorial and setup instructions. Then continue to [`print.md`](./getting-started-code.md) to begin writing your first Rust program. Each file builds upon the last and introduces a new concept, marked with a 🆕 icon the first time it appears.

Enjoy the journey!

# 🧩 Understanding Functions in Rust

Functions are one of the most important building blocks in Rust. They allow you to break your code into reusable parts, organize logic clearly, and give names to specific operations or processes.

Every Rust program starts with a special function called `main()`, but you can — and should — define your own functions too.

## 1. Defining a Simple Function

Here’s the most basic example:

```rust
fn say_hello() {
    println!("Hello from a function!");
}
```

To run this function, you call it from `main()`:

```rust
fn main() {
    say_hello();
}
```


### ✏️ Exercise: Double Trouble

Write a function called `double` that takes an `i32` and returns twice its value. Call it from `main()` with a few test values.

## 2. Functions with Parameters

You can pass data into functions using **parameters**:

```rust
fn greet(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    greet("Alice");
}
```


### ✏️ Exercise: Parameter Practice

Write a function `print_sum` that takes two `i32` parameters and prints their sum. Call it from `main()` with different values.

[Solve this exercise](../exercises/functions/02_print_sum.rs)

▶️ [Run in Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2024&code=fn+greet%28name%3A+%26str%29+%7B%0A++++println%21%28%22Hello%2C+%7B%7D%21%22%2C+name%29%3B%0A%7D%0A%0Afn+main%28%29+%7B%0A++++greet%28%22Alice%22%29%3B%0A%7D)

## 3. Functions That Return Values

Functions can also produce and return values:

```rust
fn square(n: i32) -> i32 {
    n * n
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let result = square(4);
    println!("4 squared is {}", result);
}
```


### ✏️ Exercise: Cube It

Create a function `cube` that returns the cube of an `i32`. Print the cube of several values from `main()`.

[Solve this exercise](../exercises/functions/03_cube.rs)

▶️ [Run in Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2024&code=fn+square%28n%3A+i32%29+-%3E+i32+%7B%0A++++n+*+n%0A%7D%0A%0Afn+main%28%29+%7B%0A++++let+result+%3D+square%284%29%3B%0A++++println%21%28%224+squared+is+%7B%7D%22%2C+result%29%3B%0A%7D)

## 4. Notes on Return Types

* Rust functions return the last expression by default (no `;`)
* You can use `return` for clarity, but it’s optional in simple cases
* If your function returns a value, you must use `->` followed by the return type
* If it doesn't return anything, just leave out the `->` — Rust will assume you're returning “nothing,” written as `()` behind the scenes

### ✏️ Exercise: Add Three

Write a function `add_three` that takes three `i32` values and returns their sum without using `return` or a trailing semicolon. Print the result from `main()`.

[Solve this exercise](../exercises/functions/04_add_three.rs)

## 5. Why Use Functions?

- To avoid repeating code
- To make your logic easier to read and test
- To isolate behavior for reuse across files
